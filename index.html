        <p>
          Our purpose is to put forward a unique idea to enhance communication between students and teachers and to
          illuminate the benefits that can be achieved from improved communication in the classroom. Weâ€™re also going to
          highlight innovative strategies and cutting-edge techniques that can be used to facilitate better
          communication and provide insights into why it is so essential to prioritize communication in education.

          Development of a comprehensive, systematic, and officially endorsed program by the Egyptian government,
          specifically by the Ministry of Education. This program is based on the same operating method as the "Slack"
          program. Each government or private Egyptian school, as well as each government-sponsored Egyptian university,
          will have a student community on the app.

        <h3>The Spread of Rumors and Fake News Problem</h3>
        <p>
          At the outset, I'd like one of the key features of this program to be the creation of a student community
          specifically by the Ministry of Education itself, which will disseminate official news on a regular basis,
          instead of relying on frequently manipulated social media. Each school could use its student community to
          spread important school news through an account managed by a school official.

        <h3>A solution for the issue of private lessons</h3>
        <p>
          One way to tackle the problem of private lessons is by providing digital lectures. This would allow teachers
          to present the lectures online, and students would be able to access and watch them at a later time. It's
          imperative that this service is offered completely free of charge, as it's a fundamental aspect of a teacher's
          duties. We have a suitable proposal to compensate for these funds that would satisfy both parties; the state
          would receive financial returns, leading to an increase in teacher salaries, and on the other hand, it would
          benefit students. it's going to be unveiled in the coming lines. However, it's worth reiterating that the
          availability of free digital lectures should be the driving force behind phasing out private lessons.
